# What are Lists?
A "List" is a list of words that Find searches for simultaneously. The words that a list contains are called [Words to Find](/Lists-WhatIsAWordToFind.md).

When you first install Find, 2 pre-made lists are at your disposal:
- Gluten-Free
- Word Problems

__Example:__ You make a list, called "Nature". It contains the following words:

- Tree
- Rock
- Fish
- Stick

Now, when you use this list, Find will search for "Tree", "Rock", "Fish", and "Stick" at the same time.

## Making your list
1. Start at the home screen of Find.
2. Tap the **menu** button (The 3x3 dot grid), and then tap the **Lists** button
3. Press the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zjohnzheng/FindHelp/master/images/addList.jpg" height="22"> button
4. The **List Builder** will appear! Add a name, description, and some words

## Customizing your list
__Changing the icon__
1. Tap **Icon**
2. Select an icon
&nbsp;

__Changing the color__

1. Tap **Color**
2. Select any color that you want. A color will help you organize you lists better, as well as find them faster.

> Tip: When you use the list, your selected color will be the highlight color of search results.

## Using your list

In Find, you can search for text either:
- in the home screen (using the camera)
- in Photos

In both places, your lists appear above your keyboard, like this:
