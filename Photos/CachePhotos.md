# How do I cache photos?

It's easy! You can even cache multiple photos at the same time.

**Caching an individual photo:**

1. Go to the **Photos gallery**, then tap a photo
2. The photo will zoom in, and you'll see this at the bottom of the screen:<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/FindHelp/master/images/individualImageFloat.jpg" height="80">
3. Then, tap the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/FindHelp/master/images/indCache.jpg" height="22"> button
4. Caching will begin! This will take a few seconds.

**Caching multiple photos:**

1. Go to the **Photos gallery**, then tap **Select**.
2. Select the photos that you want to cache
3. Tap the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/FindHelp/master/images/bottomFloatCache.jpg" height="22"> button
4. Caching will begin! Depending on how many photos you selected, caching will take anywhere from 5 seconds to a few minutes. Sit back and maybe get a snack or something.
