# How do I find from all my photos?

Its easy! 
1. Go to **Photos**
2. Tap the **Select** button at the top of the screen
3. Tap **Select All**
4. Tap the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zjohnzheng/FindHelp/master/images/newSearch.png" height="22"> button at the bottom of the screen
5. Enter the text that you want to find!

If all the photos that you've selected have been [cached](/History-WhatIsTheCache.md), results will appear as you type. If not, then you might need to hit the **search** button on the keyboard.
