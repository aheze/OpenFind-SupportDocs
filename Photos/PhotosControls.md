# Photos Controls
**Find:** (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/FindHelp/master/images/newSearch.png" height="22">)
Tap to **find** in the selected photo(s). If the photo is cached, search results will appear immediately. If not, you must press the **search** button on the keyboard to view results (An OCR search will be performed).

**Heart:** (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/FindHelp/master/images/heart.png" height="22">)
Tap to **heart** a photo, or **unheart** if it's already hearted. **Hearting** doesn't do anything except ad a pink tint (and a heart icon!) on the photo, making it easier to spot.

**Cache:** (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/FindHelp/master/images/cache.png" height="22">)
Tap to **cache** the selected photo(s). **Caching** will perform a Deep OCR search, which will take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute. Once a photo is **cached**, search results will appear immediately when you search in the photo. More on **caching** [here](/Photos-WhatIsTheCache.md).

**Delete:** (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/FindHelp/master/images/delete.png" height="22">)
Tap **delete** to delete the photo and its cache. This can't be undone.

**Help:** (<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aheze/FindHelp/master/images/question.png" height="22">)
Tap **help** to get help, which is what you did if you're seeing this!
