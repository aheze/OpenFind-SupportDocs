# Why does finding from Photos take so long?
First, make sure you hit the **search** button on the keyboard. Why? If a photo isn't cached, results will only appear after you tap **search**.

Anyways, when you find from Photos, Find performs an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) search. If you're only finding from a couple photos, it might not take long, but if you're finding from your entire photo gallery, expect results in 20~ish seconds.

This issue came up during development, so we made a solution: Try [Caching](/Photos-WhatIsTheCache.md)! When you cache photos, Find pre-searches them for text, so when you search in them later, results will pop up _instantly_. \*Snap\* like that.
