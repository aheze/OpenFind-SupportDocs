# What is the Cache? 

Find works by using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to search for text in photos. But because OCR is often time-consuming, Find has a feature called caching.

When you cache a photo, the OCR pre-searches it for text and saves a text file along with the image. When you search in this photo later, results will appear immediately. Photos that are cached will have this icon: ![cache]

To search in a photo that is not cached, you must press the **search** button on the keyboard. When you do this, Find searches for the word that you entered using OCR. 

> Tip: You can press **search** to OCR-search both cached photos *and* non-cached photos. You can get the most accurate results by doing this (kind of like double-checking).
